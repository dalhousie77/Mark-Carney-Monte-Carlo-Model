🇬🇧 Carney Regime Monte Carlo Quant Model

A quantitative Python simulation that models UK equity market behavior under Mark Carney’s Bank of England policy regime (2013–2020).
This project performs Monte Carlo backtesting, drift/volatility calibration, and forward scenario forecasting using FTSE 100 data.

The repository includes a clean, production-ready version of the model (carney_mc_clean.py) capable of generating regime-based market simulations.

This project explores:

How markets behaved during Mark Carney’s BoE leadership

How drift and volatility changed under his policy style

Whether a GBM Monte Carlo model replicates Carney-era market behavior

What future market paths might look like under a similar macro environment
